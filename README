Project description:
For this semester long project, I used inheritance, polymorphism, different design
patturns, etc. to create a data driven 2D game of a Harry Potter Quidditch match.

Additions for Project 6:
I added more functionality for explosions.  I made it such that
when a player explodes, all of the smart sprites go to EVADE or NORMAL mode so
that when the player comes back, it won't immediatly die by accident.  I also gave
the player 3 lives that are lost when the dementors attack it.  I created a god
mode so that the player can play without dying.  I added in conclusions for both
when the player dies 3 times and when the player collects 100 points to win.
I also added music and sound effects such as Hedwig's theme song, Harry yelling a 
spell when a two way patronus spell bullet is sent, etc.
